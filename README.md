# Coliseum Console Game

This is a console game that we made for our **"Programming Languaje"** college project.

## Summary

This game is a simple console game that you can play alone.

You’ll first need to create your own fighter, then you’ll be able to fight against other random generated fighters.

There are three types of fighters:
1. Warrior
2. Magician
3. Thief

To win the game, you’ll need to defeat the Final Boss, that will appear in the game.
